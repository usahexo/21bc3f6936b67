#  What is the average temperature in London?

The average temperature in London, England is about 8 degrees Celsius or 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

#  What is a tornado?

A tornado is a rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, a cumulus cloud. Tornadoes are often visible as a funnel cloud.

Tornadoes develop from thunderstorms. They are generally classified as either weak, strong, or violent. The most intense tornadoes are classified as EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.

The wind speed of a tornado can reach up to 295 mph (475 km/h). Tornadoes can cause significant damage to homes and businesses, as well as injure people and animals. In 2017, there were 5 confirmed fatalities from tornadoes in the United States.

#  What is a hurricane?

A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, which is a generic term for a low pressure system that forms over the water in the tropics. A tropical cyclone is classified as a hurricane when it reaches wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour (119 kilometers per hour).

There are three main stages in the life of a hurricane. The first stage is called the development stage. This is when the hurricane starts to form over the water. It starts as a cluster of thunderstorms and gradually becomes more organized.

The second stage is called the intensification stage. This is when the hurricane starts to grow in size and intensity. It can take anywhere from hours to days for a hurricane to reach its maximum strength.

The third stage is called the landfall stage. This is when the hurricane makes landfall on land. It can cause devastating damage and loss of life.

#  What is the highest recorded temperature in the world?

There is no definitive answer to this question as it largely depends on the definition of "world." If you are taking into account only land temperatures, then the record holder is Death Valley, California, which has recorded a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit. However, if you include temperatures from all areas of the world (land and sea), then the record holder is El Azizia, Libya, which recorded a temperature of 136.4 degrees Fahrenheit in 1922.

#  When do seasons change?

The earth orbits around the sun in 365.24 days, and during this orbit the earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.4 degrees. Because of this tilt, different parts of the earth experience different levels of sunlight throughout the year. Halfway through the year (around June 21), the earth is tilted so that the north pole is pointing directly towards the sun, and we have summer. About six months later (around December 21) the earth has rotated so that the south pole is pointing towards the sun and we have winter.

The changing of seasons is due to two factors- The Earth's Orbit and The Earth's Axial Tilt.
