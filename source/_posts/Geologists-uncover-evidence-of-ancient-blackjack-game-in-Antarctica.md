#  Geologists uncover evidence of ancient blackjack game in Antarctica

During a recent geological expedition to Antarctica, scientists unearthed what appears to be evidence of an ancient blackjack game. The discovery was made while the team was conducting research on the frozen continent’s ice-covered lakes.

“We were studying the sediment layers at the bottom of one of the lakes when we came across a number of objects that looked like they could have been used in a card game,” said team leader Dr. Jessica Carter. “There were two decks of cards, some chips, and what looked like a Dealer’s button.”

The objects were found in close proximity to each other, and appeared to have been deliberately buried in the sediment. Carbon dating confirms that they are over 10,000 years old – making them the oldest known example of casino games in history.

While it is not clear how exactly the game was played, it is believed that blackjack would have been the most likely option given that there were two decks of cards present. It is possible that each player would have been dealt two cards and then bet on whether they would beat the dealer’s hand or not.

If this is indeed how the game was played, it would make blackjack one of the world’s oldest known casino games. The next oldest game is probably roulette, which is thought to have originated in 18th century France.

Interestingly, there are also references to a card game called ‘twenty-one’ being played in China as early as the 10th century AD. This suggests that blackjack may actually have its origins in Asia rather than Europe.

Whatever its origins may be, there is no doubt that blackjack has become one of the most popular casino games around the world. And now thanks to this latest discovery, we know that it has been around for well over 10,000 years!

#  Casino opens in Antarctica amid protests from animal rights groups

A casino has opened in Antarctica amid protests from animal rights groups. The casino, operated by the Genting Group, has been criticized by animal rights groups for its treatment of animals.

The Genting Group has defended its treatment of animals, arguing that it is in line with international standards. The group has also announced plans to invest $2 billion in new animal-protection measures over the next five years.

Animal rights groups have vowed to continue their campaign against the casino. "It's outrageous that a casino would be allowed to open in a region where animals are already struggling to survive," said a spokesperson for PETA.

Despite the protests, the casino is doing brisk business, with people eager to try their luck in one of the most remote gambling venues in the world.

#  Researchers find new ways to beat the odds at blackjack in Antarctica

Blackjack, the popular casino game, is known for its high house edge. In most cases, playing blackjack according to basic strategy will leave the player with a disadvantage relative to the house. However, there are ways to overcome this disadvantage and even turn the odds in your favor.

In a recent study conducted by researchers at the Universidad de Concepción in Chile, a new method for beating the odds at blackjack was proposed. The method hinges on taking advantage of certain quirks in the game rules that lead to players receiving more advantageous hands.

The key to the proposed strategy is splitting pairs of Aces and 8s. This move is generally not advisable under normal circumstances, as it doubles the amount of money you have at risk. However, when playing at a casino with particular rules that offer a bonus payout for Aces and 8s, splitting these pairs can be very profitable.

In order to capitalize on this bonus payout, players need to make sure that the casino they are playing at offers it. Not all casinos do, so it is important to do your research before heading to the tables. Also, be sure to ask the dealer about any house rules that may apply before beginning play.

If you are able to find a casino with the right rules and take advantage of this new strategy, you may be able to beat the odds and come out ahead in your next blackjack game.
