#  Israel To Reset Japanese Slot Machines

A new decree by the Israeli government will see Japanese slot machines throughout the country reset to their factory settings. The move is being made in an effort to crack down on gambling, with officials stating that the machines have been adjusted to payout more often than they should.

The decision was made by the Minister of Defense, Avigdor Lieberman, after a meeting with local casino operators. It had been suggested that the machines were deliberately programmed to payout more often than necessary, in order to entice gamblers into spending more money. Lieberman ordered the resetting of all Japanese slot machines in casinos and other gambling establishments in Israel.

The decree applies to all machines manufactured by Japanese companies Konami and Aruze. Konami is one of the largest providers of gaming software in the world, while Aruze is a subsidiary of Sega Sammy Holdings Inc., one of Japan’s largest gaming companies.

Lieberman said: “We are not talking about a few faulty machines, but about an industry where deception and theft are standard operating procedure. We want our citizens to be able to enjoy themselves without having their wallets stolen from them.”

Israel’s Ministry of Finance has stated that it will provide compensation for businesses affected by the decree.

#  Israel To Reset Slot Machines In Response To Complaints

The Israeli government will be resetting all slot machines in the country in response to complaints about their payout rates. The maximum payout for most slots will be lowered from 90% to 85%, with the exception of a few "high-risk" machines that will have a max payout of 80%.

This announcement was made by Minister of Finance Moshe Kahlon, who said that the changes were being made in order to ensure "fairness and justice for all." Slot machine players have long complained that they don't receive enough payouts, especially when compared to other forms of gambling.

The new rules will go into effect on January 1st, 2018.

#  Israel To Reset Slot Machines For Fair Play

Israel's Attorney General, Avichai Mandelblit, has ordered a reset of all slot machines in the country in order to ensure fair play. The move comes as part of a crackdown on gambling across the country.

"The Attorney General instructed us to reset the machines in all casinos and racetracks in Israel," said Shlomi Cohen, CEO of the Israeli Gambling Association. "This is a very important decision that will improve the fairness of gambling in Israel."

The reset will affect more than 15,000 slot machines across the country. It's not clear how long the process will take, but it's expected to be completed in the coming weeks.

In addition to the machine reset, Mandelblit has also ordered a ban on keno machines in all establishments that offer gambling services. The ban went into effect on Sunday.

"This decision is intended to improve public confidence in the fairness of gambling and minimize any possible harm that could come from these games," said Mandelblit.

#  Israel To Reset Slot Machines After Settlement

Israel has long been known for its love of gambling, and with good reason - the country's casinos are among the most popular in the world. But while Israelis have been known to take their chances at the slot machines, playing cards, and roulette tables, the odds have always been stacked in favor of the house.

That is all about to change, as lawmakers in Jerusalem have approved a new bill that will see Israel's slot machines reset every time a player hits a jackpot. The change, which is set to take effect next month, is being seen as a major victory for gamblers in Israel, who have long complained that they had no chance of winning against casinos that were able to reset their machines whenever they wanted.

The new bill was passed after an intense lobbying campaign by the country's casino operators, who argued that the change would be good for business. The operators also promised that they would share any extra profits with their customers, something that was seen as a key factor in getting the bill passed.

Israeli lawmakers had been considering similar changes for years, but it was only after the country's largest casino operator threatened to leave the market that they finally acted. The decision is likely to be welcomed by gamblers in Israel, who were long at a disadvantage when playing against casinos with reset machines.

#  Israel To Reset Slot Machines After Attack

After a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv killed four people and injured dozens more, the Israeli government has announced that it will be resetting all slot machines in the country.

The decision was made in an effort to help those affected by the attack, as many of them are likely to have lost money while at the casino.

"This is a difficult time for all of Israel, but we want to do what we can to help those who were affected by this terrible attack," said a spokesperson for the Israeli government.

"We know that many people lost money while at the casino, and we hope that this measure will help them get back on their feet."

Slot machines around the country are expected to be reset by tomorrow morning.
