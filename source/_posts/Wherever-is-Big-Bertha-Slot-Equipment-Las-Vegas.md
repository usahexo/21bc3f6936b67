#  Wherever is Big Bertha Slot Equipment Las Vegas?

The first place that comes to mind for most of the people when it comes to the best casinos would be Las Vegas and with good reason. Sin City is home to some of the most well-known and largest gambling establishments in the world. Names like The Venetian, Wynn, MGM Grand, Bellagio and Caesars Palace are synonymous with luxury and high roller action. If you're looking for some of the biggest and best slot machines in the world, then you'll want to head over to one of these mega-resorts.

However, if you're specifically looking for Big Bertha slot machines, then you may be out of luck. While there are certainly plenty of large slot machines at these resorts, none of them are actually branded as Big Berthas. In fact, I was unable to find any casinos in Las Vegas that actually have these machines on their property.

So where can you find a Big Bertha slot machine? The answer is actually a little surprising. If you're looking for one of these beasts, your best bet is to head over to Reno or Atlantic City. These two gaming towns are home to a number of casinos that offer Big Bertha slots. In fact, many of the smaller casinos in these cities seem to specialize in these types of machines.

If you're not up for traveling though, don't worry - there are still a few places in Las Vegas where you can find large slot machines. The Excalibur and Tropicana both have a handful of big slots that range from 25 to 50 inches in size. So while you won't be able to find a Big Bertha machine per se in Las Vegas, you can still find some fairly large ones if that's what you're after.
