#  Blazers beat Warriors in dramatic fashion with last second 3-pointer!

It was a close game throughout, but the Blazers were able to pull off the upset win against the Warriors with a dramatic three pointer in the last second of the game. This was a huge win for the Blazers, who have been struggling lately, and it could give them the momentum they need to make a run in the playoffs.

The Warriors started off strong, taking an early lead in the game. However, the Blazers were not going to go down without a fight. They battled back and managed to take the lead in the second half. The Warriors responded by tying the game up late in regulation, setting up an exciting finish.

In the end, it was Damian Lillard who sealed the victory for Portland with a buzzer-beating three pointer. This was an amazing shot and it capped off an epic comeback victory for the Blazers. Lillard finished with 37 points on an incredibly efficient 12-of-21 shooting from the field. CJ McCollum added 21 points of his own, while Nurkic dominated on the inside with 20 points and 18 rebounds.

The Warriors were led by Kevin Durant’s 43 points on 17-of-29 shooting from the field. Klay Thompson chipped in 23 points of his own, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Portland’s late surge.

This was a thrilling game and it showed just how evenly matched these two teams are. The Blazers will be hoping that this win can help them turn their season around and make a deep playoff run.

#  Nurkic dominates the paint as Blazers win their 5th straight game!

After a disappointing 2017-2018 season, the Portland Trail Blazers are back and looking better than ever. Led by their center Nurkic, the Blazers have won 5 games in a row, including an impressive win against the Golden State Warriors.

Nurkic was dominant in the paint against the Warriors, scoring 28 points and grabbing 20 rebounds. His toughness and aggressive play has been a huge lift for the Blazers, who are now one of the most exciting teams in the league to watch.

The key to Nurkic’s success has been his improved shooting. This season, he is making over 50% of his shots from within 3 feet of the basket, compared to just 37% last year. With his ability to score down low and rebound efficiently, Nurkic is quickly becoming one of the best players in the NBA.

The Blazers will need Nurkic to continue playing well if they want to make a deep playoff run this year. With Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum leading the way, Portland has the firepower to compete with any team in the league. If Nurkic can stay healthy and lead them on both ends of the floor, there’s no doubt that they can go all the way this year.

#  Lillard and McCollum lead Blazers to another victory over a top Western Conference opponent!

The Portland Trail Blazers (20-11) have been one of the biggest surprises in the NBA this season, and they continued their strong play with a 116-105 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder (21-10) on Sunday. Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum led the way for the Blazers with 29 and 25 points respectively, and they once again proved that they can compete with the best teams in the Western Conference.

This was a huge win for Portland, as the Thunder are one of the top teams in the West and they have been playing extremely well lately. Russell Westbrook had another triple-double (27 points, 17 rebounds, and 16 assists), but it wasn't enough to overcome Lillard and McCollum's dominance.

The Blazers have now won six of their last seven games, and they appear to be getting better each time out. Lillard is averaging 26.8 points per game this season, while McCollum is posting 23.4 points per contest. They are both outstanding scorers, but they also make sure to involve their teammates so that everyone can be productive on offense.

Portland's next game is against the Golden State Warriors (26-6) on Wednesday night. This will be a tough matchup, but if Lillard and McCollum can continue playing at this high level, then there's no reason why the Blazers can't pull off an upset.

#  McCollum hits clutch 3-pointer to send Blazers past Timberwolves! 

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- CJ McCollum hit a clutch 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds remaining to help the Portland Trail Blazers edge the Minnesota Timberwolves 103-101 on Tuesday night.

With the game tied at 101, McCollum took an inbounds pass from Damian Lillard and stepped back behind the arc to knock down the decisive shot.

Lillard had 29 points and 11 assists for Portland, while McCollum finished with 25 points. Karl-Anthony Towns led Minnesota with 27 points and 12 rebounds.

The Wolves had one final chance after McCollum's shot, but Andrew Wiggins' off-balance jumper at the buzzer came up short.

#  Trail Blazers continue their stellar play with another win against the Kings!

The Portland Trail Blazers are one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now. They continue their stellar play by scoring another win against the Sacramento Kings.

Damian Lillard led the Blazers with 22 points, while C.J. McCollum added 20 points of his own. Zach Randolph led the Kings with 18 points, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Portland’s offense.

This was a very close game throughout, but the Blazers were able to pull away in the end. They shot 47 percent from the field and 38 percent from three-point range, while the Kings shot 44 percent from the field and 36 percent from three-point range.

The Blazers have now won six of their last seven games and are currently in fifth place in the Western Conference playoff standings. They will look to continue their hot streak when they take on the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday night.
